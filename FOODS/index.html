        <h2>water</h2>
        <p>water is a clear liquid that has no color, taste, or smell, that falls from clouds as rain, that forms streams, lakes, and seas, and that is used for drinking, washing, etc.</p>
        <p>A colorless, odorless compound of hydrogen and oxygen. Water covers about three-quarters of the Earth's surface in solid form (ice) and liquid form, and is prevalent in the lower atmosphere in its gaseous form, water vapor.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>portable water</dt>
            <dd>Potable water is defined as water that is suitable for human consumption (i.e., water that can be used for drinking or cooking)</dd>
            <dt>fresh water</dt>
            <dd> freshwater is water containing less than 1,000 milligrams per liter of dissolved solids, most often salt. As a part of the water cycle, Earth's surface-water bodies are generally thought of as renewable resources, although they are very dependent on other parts of the water cycle</dd>
            <dt>salt water</dt>
            <dd>Salt water (or saline water) is water with a large amount of salt in it. It usually means the water from the seas and oceans (sea water)</dd>
            <dt>distilled water</dt>
            <dd>Distilled water is water that has been boiled into vapor and condensed back into liquid in a separate container. Impurities in the original water that do not boil below or near the boiling point of water remain in the original container</dd>
            <dt>hard water</dt>
            <dd>hard water, water that contains salts of calcium and magnesium principally as bicarbonates, chlorides, and sulfates. Ferrous iron may also be present; oxidized to the ferric form, it appears as a reddish brown stain on washed fabrics and enameled surfaces</dd>
